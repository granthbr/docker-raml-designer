# docker-raml-designer

Embedded RAML API Designer


# Why use this?

Instead of using the provided RAML API Designer in the Cloud or intsalling it locally, it can be installed anywhere Docker is 
installed. It will be persisted once intitally created if the Docker cached file is not removed.

# Goals

Eventually will be setup as a combined Docker cluster of API Designer and API Notebook started with docker-compose.
